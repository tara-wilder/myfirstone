{"title":"Assignments, Points, and Grading","markdown":{"headingText":"Assignments, Points, and Grading","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-assignments","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## Activities and Assignments (512 points)[^assignments-points-grades-1]\n\nIn this class we emphasize *process* over *product* - and because this is a 5000-level course which encourages use of all available resources, I will expect you to learn through your own reading, writing, and experience in addition to materials from lecture and class activities. In other words, lecture in this class is not designed to spoon-feed you everything you need to know - instead lecture will be a place to construct some basic knowledge scaffolds and ask questions in the process. We will use the [course textbook @sec-textbook] as a basic scaffold for most of the information but will also be building our own wiki-style textbook as we go throughout the semester. \n\nThe activities and assignments in this class are designed around several organizing principles:\n\n- We will strive for deep integration of theory, measurement and application.\n- I will ask you to stretch your comfort zones and challenge you to grow.\n- A significant emphasis is placed on engagement and effort - I don't expect you to come into this class with any particular skill set. I do expect you to put forth the effort to learn new things.\n- We will work on asking questions (see @sec-thinking5yo) (lots of questions!) and foster independence and curiosity.\n- We will code! We will work with raw data! We will practice research and citation skills!\n- Although there will be work you will need to do on your own time, we will also provide the time and space for in-class work on most assignments.\n- Weekly practice and group collaboration is very important!\n\n**Weekly Reading Annotations and Wiki Contributions (56 points, 11% of your grade)**\n\nEach week, you will be asked to complete required readings, largely from Vepraskas and Craft, 2016. To encourage [slow reading @sec-reading] I will ask that you provide an *active reading audit trail* in the form of annotations and marginalia (either physical or digital). You will turn this in on Canvas each week. Additionally, each week you will be asked to contribute a minimum of 5 researched citations and 3 pieces of content (either full pages or sections) to our class wiki, which you will be asked to summarize using a [wiki-contribution log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRmGtMAoqWovaImaEfK-w8DJwKZDGL7ErcGff5PhSyI/edit?usp=sharing). Your reading annotations and wiki-contributions will be due on Friday of each week. (14 Reading Audits x 2 points + 14 wiki contributions x 2 points = 56 points).\n\n**Lecture Reflections (56 points, 11% of your grade)**\nIn every lecture, you will be given a sheet with questions or reflection prompts. These will be completed during lecture. If you miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to complete the lecture reflection for points on your own. (28 reflections x 2 points = 56 points).\n\n**Field Trip Reports (45 points, 9% of your grade)**\n\nYou will be required to write a brief report for three of the four field sessions.  More specific details will be given before each field session.  You will be working in groups on the field sessions and each group will turn in a single report.  It should be well-written, clear and concise and follow standard format for soil profile descriptions that will be provided. (3 reports x 15 points = 45 points).\n\n**Assignment 1: Biochemistry Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nYou will be given access to a simplified R shiny app which will allow you to adjust parameters and experiment with what happens to soil redox potential under different scenarios. This will allow you to further your understanding of the biochemical processes that lead to redox reactions in wet soils. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\n\n**Assignment 2: Redox Vial Project (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nWe will set up an experiment to monitor the formation of soil redoximorphic features in controlled vials throughout the semester.  You will work in groups but turn in an **individual report online.** (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\n\n**Assignment 3: Hydric Soils Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nYou will be given a set of soil profile descriptions and will determine if the soils are hydric or non-hydric and why.  You will turn in individual reports, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\n\n**Assignment 4: Soil Hydrology Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nYou will be asked to interpret the type of hydrology for specified wetlands and interpret hydrologic monitoring data from piezometers and tensiometers. **Independent work.** (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\n\n**Assignment 5: Wetland Assessment Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nYou will be provided with an area that contains significant hydric soils and will describe the nature of the wetlands and hydric soil conditions on site using publicly available digital resources such as Digital Elevation Models (and derivatives), the National Wetland Inventory, and . **Independent work and turn in online.** (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\n\n**Assignment 6: Wetland Case Study (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nYou will select a wetland type and location of interest to you and produce a 2 page technical summary of the soils, hydrology and vegetation of the wetland system. **Independent work and turn in online.** (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\n\n**Group Hydric Soil Delineation Project (150 points, 30% of your grade)**\n\nYour group (3-4 students) will be assigned a parcel of Rice Creek North Regional Trail Corridor land located to the north of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in Shoreview.  Your task will be to delineate all areas of hydric soils within your parcel of approximately 40 acres.  Your group will flag the boundary in some sections (that I will field check); prepare a map of hydric soils; descriptions of upland, transitional, and hydric soils; and compile a comprehensive report for the site.  Final projects will be due on **Monday, December 8**.  We will provide field equipment for this project and be available on certain dates to answer questions in the field.  Your group will compile a single report including background information, soil profile data, landscape descriptions, general vegetation, presumed hydrology, and a map of the hydric soil boundary for your assigned parcel of land.  You will use QGIS or ArcGIS to assist in the preparation of your final project and you will submit your project in an electronic pdf file.  More details for the report will be provided in the laboratory session. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\n\n**Midterm Exam (50 points, 10% of your grade)**\n\nThe midterm exam will be given in-person in Room 365 Borlaug Hall. More information will be provided prior to the exam. (1 midterm exams x 50 points = 50 points).\n\n**Small Group Activity/In-Class Wetland Assessment Proficiency (15 points, 3% of your grade)**\n\nIn this small group activity and proficiency assessment, you will be split into groups and assigned a location during our lab session and produce an initial technical report on the location by utilizing publicly available resources. Your technical report will be due by the end of the class session. (1 small group activity exam x 50 points = 50 points).\n\n**Final Comprehensive Exam (50 points, 10% of your grade)**\n\nThe final exam will be comprehensive. (1 final exam x 50 points = 50 points).\n\n## Grade Drops and Adjustments Prior to Final Grade Calculation:\n\nYou may drop the lowest of each of the following prior to the calculation of final grades:\n\n- 2 Weekly Reading Annotations\n- 2 Lecture Reflections\n- 1 Assignment\n\nDropped scores will *NOT* be allowed for the following activities:\n\n- Exams (including in-class group wetland assessment proficiency).\n- Field Trip Reports.\n- Group Hydric Soil Delineation Project\n\n### Final Grades\n\nFinal course grades use the +/- system of grading. Course grades will be assigned using the following scale, which is based on the UMN [Grading and Transcripts Policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/gradingtranscripts):\n\n| **Letter Grade** | **Percent** |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| A                | \\> 93       |\n| A-               | 90 to \\< 93 |\n| B+               | 87 to \\< 90 |\n| B                | 83 to \\< 87 |\n| B-               | 80 to \\< 83 |\n| C+               | 77 to \\<80  |\n| C                | 73 to \\< 77 |\n| C-               | 70 to \\< 73 |\n| D+               | 67 to \\< 70 |\n| D                | 60 to \\< 67 |\n| F                | \\< 60       |\n\n::: callout-note\nA grade of C- is required to pass this class if you elected to take this course under the Pass/Fail grading system.\n:::\n\n### Grade Assignments\n\nGrades will be assigned by earned point values as described on this page. No curve will be applied. **I do not oblige requests for grade \"bump-ups\" for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. However, I do calculate everybody's final grade with a 0.5% grace. So, in other words, if you are within 0.5% of the next grade category you will receive the higher grade. Be proud of the grade you earned!**\n\n### Grading Challenges\n\nAny challenges to graded assignments you wish to be considered should be emailed to the instructor within **one week** of the posting date of the graded item.\n\n### Student Workload Statement\n\nThis course conforms to the UMN [expected time per course credit policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/timepercredit#:~:text=Student%20workload%20expectations%20per%20undergraduate%20credit.&text=One%20credit%20equals%2045%20hours,45%20hours%20of%20academic%20work).) Per that policy:\n\n-   For all academic sessions, courses, and modalities, hours of instructional time for a course must equal at least the number of credits for the course times 15 weeks in an academic term. 3 credits x 1 hour in class per credit (average) x 15 weeks = 45 hours of in-class instructional time.\n\n-   One credit equals 3 hours of work per week (both in and out of class). So, a 3 credit class equals 3 credits x 3 hours/credit = 9 hours per week. 3 credits x 3 hours per week x 15 weeks = 135 hours total\n\nHere is how the course conforms:\n\n| **Activity**     | **Number** | **Hours**         |\n|------------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Lectures\\*       | 27      | 27 x 0.84 = 23 hours |\n| Assignments\\    | 6         | 6 x 3 = 18 hours |\n| Lab/Field Sessions\\*           | 8         | 8 x 3 = 24 hours |\n| Field Trip Reports\\           | 3         | 3 x 3 = 9 hours |\n| Hydric Soil Delin. Proj.  | 1          | 1 x 25 = 25 hours   |\n| Weekly Reading Annotations & Wiki | 14 | 14 x 2 = 28 hours |\n| Midterm Exam | 1         | 1 x 2 = 2 hours |\n| Small Group Exam | 1         | 1 x 3 = 3 hours |\n| Final Exam           | 1          | 1 x 3 = 3 hours |\n|                  | IN CLASS\\* | 47 hours          |\n|                  | TOTAL\\    | 135 hours
